# ANLP - Lab 8: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository contains the implementation of **Lab 8** from the Applied Natural Language Processing (CAI451) course by **Professor Badr Aldaihani**, completed by **Wajd Alrabiah (443007641)**.  
It explores various methods of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using FAISS, Pinecone, and Hugging Face models.

---

## Overview

This lab demonstrates how to:
1. Create a **basic RAG pipeline** using document embeddings and cosine similarity.
2. Implement **FAISS-based retrieval** for efficient similarity search.
3. Integrate **LLaMA models** for generative responses based on retrieved content.
4. Extract and embed **text from PDF documents** using **PyMuPDF** and **Sentence Transformers**.
5. Store and query embeddings from a **Pinecone cloud vector database**.

## Features

- **Sentence Embeddings** using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **FAISS Integration** for local similarity search
- **Pinecone Integration** for scalable vector storage
- **PDF Text Extraction** with `PyMuPDF`
- **LLM Response Generation** with `LLaMA-3.2-1B`
- End-to-end **RAG Pipeline**

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page!  
I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
